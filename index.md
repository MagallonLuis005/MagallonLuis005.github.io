## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* LAB 7, Part 1

    I enjoyed working on this lab as it allowed me to use critical thinking and forced me to exit my comfort zone. I liked applying the set of skills I learned with C++ programming into a real world scenario, such as the parking system in this lab. This lab was very engaging, and aside from the initial struggle, I felt this lab allowed me to properly exercise my abilities in C++ programming.

* LAB 6, Part 1

    This lab was about creating a C++ program that would allow the user to make a sandwich order, similar to the Mad Libs word game. I enjoyed working on this lab as I found it entertaining and fun to work on. In terms of programming, I believe that my performance was well. 

* LAB 10, Part 1

    Lab 10, part 1, focused on organizing population data among California counties. While completing this lab, I struggled and had many points of confusion. Though it was difficult, I enjoyed this as it reminded me of the initial struggle for a brighter future outcome. My partner and I completed part 1 and performed well on this section. Overall, this lab was a good lesson for me as a beginner in the computer science study field.
